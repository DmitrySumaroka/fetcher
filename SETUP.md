# Setup #

## Ubuntu ##
Fetcher was designed and tested using Ubnuntu servers and this is currently the most stable environment to run it on.
If all goes well, fetcher should just work on an Ubuntu server using Apache and MySql with standard setup.

## CentOs ##
Non-Posix systems require the php-posix library to be added. Fetcher will fail without this.
Run "yum install php-posix" to resolve this issue.
